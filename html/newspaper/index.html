                    Over General
                    In Civilian Job</h2>

                <p class="text first">
                    WASHINGTON — Presidentelect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s intention to nominate a retired Army
                    general as secretary of defense
                    has run into bipartisan resistance
                    on Capitol Hill, where there are
                    growing concerns about another
                    former commander leading the
                    Pentagon in a nation that has a
                    long tradition of civilian control of
                    the military.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, a fourstar Army general who retired in
                    2016, was named on Tuesday by
                    Mr. Biden as his pick — and would
                    be the first Black defense secretary. But General Austin would
                    need a congressional waiver to
                    serve, required for any Pentagon
                    chief who has been retired from
                    active-duty military service less
                    than seven years.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    Rejecting a waiver for such a
                    historic nominee could be tricky
                    for lawmakers, especially those
                    who four years ago approved a
                    similar measure for President
                    Trump’s first defense secretary,
                    Jim Mattis, a retired four-star Marine officer. But many lawmakers
                    said Tuesday they do not want the
                    practice enshrined into American
                    political life.</p>
                <blockquote class="quote-text">
                    “I have the deepest respect and
                    admiration for General Austin”
                </blockquote>
                <p class="text">
                    “I have the deepest respect and
                    admiration for General Austin,”
                    said Senator Richard Blumenthal,
                    a Connecticut Democrat who
                    serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “His nomination
                    is exciting and historic. But I believe that a waiver of the sevenyear rule would contravene the
                    basic principle that there should
                    be civilian control of a nonpolitical
                    military.”</p>
                <p class="text">
                    Many lawmakers said they reluctantly voted for a waiver for
                    Mr. Mattis to provide a counterbalance to Mr. Trump’s inexperience and bombastic style, and
                    now question the need to violate a
                    cornerstone of American national
                    security policy so quickly again.
                    An approval for General Austin
                    would underscore how deeply Mr.
                    Trump has altered the norms in civilian oversight of the military.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="big-quote">
                    “I supported a one-time waiver in the case of Secretary James Mattis with the belief that the
                    circumstances at the time warranted a rare exception, not the establishment of a new precedent,
                    which erodes the basic principle of civilian control of the military,” said Senator Susan Collins,
                    Republican of Maine. “I would need to take a hard look at the Biden administration’s justification
                    for such a waiver before reaching a conclusion on whether or not one is warranted in this case.”

                    On the afternoon of Sept. 8, AstraZeneca officials had a conference call with the Food and Drug
                    Administration. The discussion
                    covered important ground: What
                    would AstraZeneca need to do to
                    win the F.D.A.’s blessing for the coronavirus vaccine it was developing with the University of
                    Oxford?</p>
                <p class="text">
                    But the AstraZeneca representatives neglected
                    to mention a crucial development: Two days earlier,
                    the company had quietly halted
                    trials of its vaccine around the
                    world, including a late-stage
                    study in the United States. It acted
                    after a participant in Britain fell ill.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    A few hours after the conference call,
                    the story broke about
                    the halted trials. That was how
                    key F.D.A. officials heard the
                    news, according to people with
                    knowledge of the discussions.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The F.D.A.’s commissioner, Dr.
                    Stephen Hahn, was stunned by
                    AstraZeneca’s failure to disclose
                    the halt to regulators, one of the
                    people said. The U.S. government
                    had pledged more than $1 billion
                    to AstraZeneca to finance the development and manufacturing of
                    its vaccine and to supply the
                    United States with 300 million
                    doses if it proved effective. F.D.A.
                    regulators expected to be kept in
                    the loop.

                    As Covid Vaccine Offers
                    Hope to a Weary World</h2>
                <p class="autor">By BENJAMIN MUELLER</p>
                <p class="text first">
                    LONDON — In March, the
                    emergency room doctor was bedridden with the first case of the coronavirus among his colleagues at
                    a hospital in Wales. Within weeks,
                    he was back in scrubs, tending to a
                    crush of ill, breathless patients.
                    On Tuesday, after having
                    weathered each turn in Britain’s
                    ravaging bout with the coronavirus, the doctor, Farbod Babolhavaeji, was given one of the
                    world’s first shots of a clinically
                    authorized, fully tested vaccine —
                    a step in the long, painstaking
                    campaign to knock back a disease
                    that has killed more than 1.5 million people worldwide.
                    Images of the first people to be
                    vaccinated were broadcast
                    around the country, led by Margaret Keenan, 90, a former jewelry shop assistant in a “Merry
                    Christmas” T-shirt, and an 81-
                    year-old man with the improbable
                    name of William Shakespeare.
                    They quickly became emblems of
                    the remarkable race to make a
                    vaccine, and the world’s agonizing
                    wait for relief from deaths now
                    numbering 11,000 a day.
                    Never before has Britain undertaken such a fiendishly difficult
                    mass vaccination program. Given
                    pizza-box-like trays of 975 doses
                    each, hospitals stored them in
                    deep freezers, defrosted them
                    and, on Tuesday, drew them up
                    into individual syringes and
                    jabbed them into the upper arms
                    of variously jubilant and needleshy Britons. Every minute mattered: Defrosted doses that were
                    not given by Friday would be
                    wasted.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    “We’re doing it with military
                    precision,” said Fiona Kinghorn,
                    the hospital administrator in
                    charge of vaccines in the Welsh
                    capital, Cardiff, where 225 doses,
                    including Dr. Babolhavaeji’s, were
                    planned for Tuesday. “And, in fact,
                    we have had the military helping
                    our planning.”
                    For the first recipients, among
                    them older Britons and hundreds
                    of doctors and nurses who pulled
                    the National Health Service
                    through the pandemic, the shots
                    offered a glimpse at life after
                    Covid-19, replete with plans for rescheduled wedding anniversaries
                    and bus trips to the seaside.
                    Those hopes were bolstered by
                    the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, which
                    said on Tuesday that the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, the same one
                    being given in Britain, provided
                    strong protection against Covid-19
                    within about 10 days after the first
                    dose, sooner than had previously
                    been believed.
